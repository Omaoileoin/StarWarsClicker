Game Parameters


The game area is a background of the Death Star in Star Wars.
Your goal is to shoot down the enemy x-wing trying to destroy the Death Star.
The x-wing is confined to the game area by ‘if statements’ to prevent clipping outside the game area.
The x-wing will randomly move around the screen every 1.5 seconds trying to evade you.
There is a target reticle that you will use to aim, and you will click on the x-wing to destroy it.
If you are able to click on the x-wing, a score counter at the top left of the screen will increase by 1 each time.
Once you have destroyed 20 x-wings, the game is over and you are congratulated for defending the Death Star.
